                What is inflation and how does it work?
            </h2>

            <p class="page__section-paragraph">
                Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising and,
                subsequently, the purchasing power of currency is falling. Inflation is a hidden tax that erodes
                your purchasing power. It is important to understand that inflation is not a one-time event. It
                is a continuous process that occurs over time.
            </p>

            <p class="page__section-paragraph">
                Polish central bank (Narodowy Bank Polski) has set the inflation target at 2.5%, which in long run
                (20 years)
                seems to be maintained.
            </p>

            <p class="page__section-paragraph">
                Check out how very high inflation affects products' prices over the years. The inicial price is $100
                and we assume inflation of 17.9% per year (October inflation value recorded in Poland).

                As you can see, inflation is very dangerous in longer periods of time, because the cumulative
