                What is inflation and how does it work?
            </h2>

            <p class="page__section-paragraph">
                Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising and,
                subsequently, the purchasing power of currency is falling. Inflation is a hidden tax that erodes
                your purchasing power. It is important to understand that inflation is not a one-time event. It
                is a continuous process that occurs over time.
            </p>

            <p class="page__section-paragraph">
                Polish central bank (Narodowy Bank Polski) has set the inflation target at 2.5%, which in long run
                (20 years)
                seems to be maintained.
            </p>

            <p class="page__section-paragraph">
                Check out how very high inflation affects products' prices over the years. The inicial price is $100
                and we assume inflation of 17.9% per year (October inflation value recorded in Poland).

                As you can see, inflation is very dangerous in longer periods of time, because the cumulative

                It means that your saving are now work for you 22.8 times less than they did 20 years ago.
